### Design decision
- In order to comply with the requirements of providing a solution in the order of O(log n) in regard to time complexity a binary search algorithm was used. 
- Space complexity of this approach is O(1) because the number to be looked for can be found inside the input list and no additional data structure is needed other than space in which the local variables are stored.
